# Session Monitor Fixes

## Overview

This document details the fixes applied to the SessionMonitor component to resolve random sign-out issues.

## Issues Identified

1. **Race Condition During Initialization**: The 5-second delay before starting activity tracking could miss initial user activity
2. **Aggressive Timeout Calculation**: Client-side calculations didn't sync with Clerk's server-side session timing
3. **Memory Leaks**: Cleanup function was inside setTimeout callback
4. **Missing Error Boundaries**: No error handling for localStorage or sign-out failures
5. **No Clerk Session Sync**: Component didn't verify actual Clerk session status

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Memory Leak Fix
- Moved cleanup function outside setTimeout
- Properly handle component unmounting
- Clear all intervals and broadcast channels on cleanup

### 2. Clerk Session Verification
- Added `useSession()` hook to check actual Clerk session status
- Verify session validity before showing warnings or signing out
- Check Clerk's `expireAt` timestamp before taking any action

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around localStorage operations
- Handle network failures during sign-out
- Fallback to redirect even if signOut fails

### 4. Improved Timing Logic
- Added 30-second buffer to prevent premature warnings
- Reduced initial delay from 5 to 2 seconds
- Implemented exponential backoff for session checks (30s to 5min)

### 5. Better Cross-Tab Communication
- Added BroadcastChannel API as primary method
- Fallback to localStorage for older browsers
- Proper event handling for both methods

### 6. Debug Mode
- Enable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_SESSION=true` in development
- Logs all state changes and timing calculations
- Helps diagnose issues in production

## Testing the Session Monitor

### Basic Testing

1. **Enable Debug Mode** (optional):
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_SESSION=true npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Inactivity Warning**:
   - Log into the application
   - Don't interact for 25 minutes
   - Verify warning modal appears
   - Click "Stay Logged In" to reset timer

3. **Test Auto-Logout**:
   - Let the warning countdown expire
   - Verify automatic logout and redirect

4. **Test Cross-Tab Sync**:
   - Open multiple tabs
   - Be active in one tab
   - Verify other tabs don't show warnings

5. **Test Activity Detection**:
   - Interact with the page (click, type, scroll)
   - Check console logs (if debug mode enabled)
   - Verify activity is detected

### Advanced Testing

1. **Test Network Failures**:
   - Use browser dev tools to simulate offline
   - Let session expire
   - Verify graceful handling

2. **Test Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test in browsers without BroadcastChannel support
   - Verify localStorage fallback works

3. **Test Memory Leaks**:
   - Navigate away from dashboard and back
   - Check browser memory usage
   - Verify no duplicate intervals

## Configuration

The session timeout values are configured in two places:

1. **Clerk Dashboard**: Server-side session expiration (30 minutes)
2. **session-config.ts**: Client-side warning timings

Make sure these values are synchronized for best user experience.

## Monitoring

Watch for these in production:
- Console errors containing `[SessionMonitor]`
- Users reporting unexpected logouts
- High frequency of `session_expired` redirects

## Future Improvements

1. Add telemetry for session timeout events
2. Implement session extension without full page refresh
3. Add user preference for warning time
4. Consider using Clerk's built-in session management features when available
