# Security Enhancement TODO

This file tracks security enhancements from the comprehensive security plan.

## ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1: Critical Security (Implemented)

### Authorization Framework ✅
- ✅ **Authorization Middleware**: Created `src/lib/auth-middleware.ts` with:
  - `requireAuth()` - Basic user authentication
  - `requireHouseholdAccess()` - Household-level authorization
  - `requireTransactionAccess()` - Transaction-level authorization  
  - `requireAccountAccess()` - Account-level authorization
- ✅ **API Routes Updated**: Applied authorization to critical endpoints:
  - `/api/transactions/[id]/*` - All CRUD operations secured
  - `/api/households/[id]/*` - All CRUD operations secured
  - `/api/households/[id]/active-month` - Access control added

### Input Validation ✅
- ✅ **Zod Validation Framework**: Created `src/lib/validation.ts` with:
  - Transaction validation schemas (create/update)
  - Household validation schemas (create/update)
  - Account validation schemas (create/update)
  - Category validation schemas (create/update)
  - User validation schemas (update)
  - Invitation validation schemas (create)
  - Query parameter validation (pagination, date ranges)
  - Utility functions: `validateRequestBody()`, `validateQueryParams()`
- ✅ **Applied to Critical Routes**: Validation active on transactions and households APIs

### Security Vulnerabilities Fixed ✅
- ✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**: Replaced raw SQL in `/api/households/[id]/active-month` with Prisma's safe query methods
- ✅ **Authorization Bypass**: Users can no longer access other users' data by changing IDs in URLs

### Security Headers ✅
- ✅ **Comprehensive Security Headers** in `src/middleware.ts`:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) with Clerk integration
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Permissions-Policy (geolocation, camera, microphone restrictions)
  - HSTS for HTTPS connections

### Rate Limiting Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ **Rate Limiting System**: Created `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` with:
  - Flexible rate limiting configuration
  - In-memory store with automatic cleanup
  - Pre-configured rate limiters: `apiRateLimit`, `authRateLimit`, `strictRateLimit`, `uploadRateLimit`
  - Client IP detection with multiple header support
  - User-based rate limiting capabilities

### Enhanced Error Handling ✅
- ✅ **Request/Response Sanitization**: Enhanced `src/lib/error-logger.ts` with:
  - Sensitive data masking in logs
  - Header sanitization
  - Request body sanitization
  - Comprehensive error context logging

## ✅ COMPLETED - Phase 2: Enhanced Security (Medium Priority)

### API Route Authorization Updates ✅
**Completed:**
- ✅ `/api/transactions/[id]` - GET, PUT, DELETE with authorization
- ✅ `/api/transactions/route.ts` - GET, POST with authorization and validation
- ✅ `/api/transactions/date-ranges/route.ts` - GET with authorization
- ✅ `/api/transactions/sankey/route.ts` - GET with authorization
- ✅ `/api/households/[id]` - GET, PUT, DELETE with authorization  
- ✅ `/api/households/[id]/active-month` - GET with authorization
- ✅ `/api/households/[id]/members/route.ts` - GET with authorization
- ✅ `/api/households/[id]/members/[userId]/route.ts` - PATCH, DELETE with authorization
- ✅ `/api/households/[id]/invitations/route.ts` - GET, POST with authorization
- ✅ `/api/invitations/by-id/[id]/route.ts` - DELETE with authorization
- ✅ `/api/invitations/by-token/[token]/route.ts` - GET with authorization
- ✅ `/api/invitations/by-token/[token]/accept/route.ts` - POST with authorization (already had it)
- ✅ `/api/accounts/*` routes - All routes secured with household-level authorization
- ✅ `/api/categories/*` routes - All routes secured with household-level authorization
- ✅ `/api/types/*` routes - All routes secured with household-level authorization
- ✅ `/api/types/[id]/route.ts` - GET, PUT, DELETE with authorization
- ✅ `/api/types/bulk/route.ts` - POST with authorization
- ✅ `/api/users/[id]/route.ts` - GET, PUT, DELETE with authorization

### Enhanced Rate Limiting ✅
**Completed:**
- ✅ Rate limiting infrastructure and utilities created
- ✅ Pre-configured rate limiters available (`apiRateLimit`, `authRateLimit`, `strictRateLimit`, `uploadRateLimit`)
- ✅ Applied `authRateLimit` to invitation acceptance endpoint
- ✅ Applied `uploadRateLimit` to bulk transaction uploads
- ✅ Applied `strictRateLimit` to analytics endpoints (transactions, sankey)
- ✅ Applied `authRateLimit` to user enumeration endpoints
- ✅ Applied `apiRateLimit` to all secured account/category/type routes
- ✅ Applied `apiRateLimit` to all transaction endpoints
- ✅ Applied `apiRateLimit` to all member management endpoints
- ✅ Applied `apiRateLimit` to all invitation endpoints

### CORS Configuration ✅
- ✅ Configure proper CORS policies for API routes in middleware
- ✅ Restrict allowed origins, methods, and headers
- ✅ Add CORS preflight handling for complex requests (OPTIONS method)

## Phase 3: Advanced Security (Lower Priority)

### Audit Logging
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging system
- [ ] Log all financial data access and modifications
- [ ] Include user identification, timestamps, and action details
- [ ] Create audit log retention and rotation policies
- [ ] Add audit log analysis and alerting

### Enhanced Authentication Security
- [✅] Implement session timeout policies
  - ✅ Created session configuration documentation (docs/SESSION_CONFIGURATION.md)
  - ✅ Implemented client-side session monitoring with inactivity warnings
  - ✅ Added automatic logout on session expiry
- [ ] Add device fingerprinting for suspicious login detection
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication support

### Data Protection
- [ ] Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Add data masking for financial amounts in logs

### Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Set up security monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Implement real-time threat detection
- [ ] Add alerting for suspicious activities:
  - Multiple failed login attempts
  - Unusual data access patterns
  - Large data exports
  - Admin privilege escalations
- [ ] Create incident response procedures

### Infrastructure Security (Partially Complete)
**Completed:**
- ✅ Request/response sanitization (error logging with data masking)

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Create secure configuration management
- [ ] Implement secrets rotation policies


## Implementation Notes

### Audit Logging Schema
```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  id: string
  userId: string
  action: string
  resource: string
  resourceId: string
  oldValues?: Record<string, any>
  newValues?: Record<string, any>
  ipAddress: string
  userAgent: string
  timestamp: Date
  success: boolean
  errorMessage?: string
}
```

### Security Monitoring Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts per user/IP
- Data access patterns and anomalies
- API response times and error rates
- Database query performance and suspicious queries
- File upload activities and sizes

## Priority Order for Implementation
